# README.me
This is my emacs configuration tree, continually used and tweaked since 2017, and it may be some improvement.
These days it's somewhat geared towards OS X, but it is known to also work on Linux and Windows.

Emacs itself comes with support for many programming languages. This config adds improved defaults and extended
support for the following, listed in the approximate order of how much I use them, from most to least:

Lisp
Python

In particular, there's a nice config for autocompletion with company, and flycheck is used to immediately highlight
syntax errors in Python.
